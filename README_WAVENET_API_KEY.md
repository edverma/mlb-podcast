# Google Wavenet Implementation with API Key Authentication

This document summarizes the changes made to implement Google Cloud Wavenet Text-to-Speech using API key authentication instead of service account credentials.

## Changes Made

1. **Modified the `GoogleWavenetTTS` class**:
   - Removed service account authentication
   - Implemented direct REST API calls with API key authentication
   - Added proper handling of API responses, including Base64 decoding
   - Simplified initialization process

2. **Updated configuration files**:
   - Changed `GOOGLE_CLOUD_CREDENTIALS` to `GOOGLE_CLOUD_API_KEY` in `config.py`
   - Updated `.env.example` to reflect the new API key usage

3. **Updated documentation**:
   - Modified `docs/google_wavenet_setup.md` to describe API key setup
   - Simplified installation process (no need to download credentials file)

4. **Created migration script**:
   - Added support for transitioning from service account to API key
   - Updated environment variable handling
   - Improved installation guide with API key instructions

## Benefits of Using API Key Authentication

1. **Simplified Setup**: No need to create and manage service account credentials file
2. **Easier Security Management**: API keys can be easily restricted, rotated, and monitored
3. **Reduced Configuration Overhead**: No need for environment variables or credentials file paths
4. **Better Portability**: Works across environments without configuration changes

## How to Get an API Key

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
3. Click "Create Credentials" at the top
4. Select "API key"
5. Your API key will be created and displayed
6. Optional but recommended: Click "Restrict Key" to limit its use to only the Text-to-Speech API

## Implementation Details

The implementation now uses direct REST API calls to the Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API endpoint:

```python
url = f"https://texttospeech.googleapis.com/v1/text:synthesize?key={self.api_key}"
response = requests.post(url, json=payload)
```

The API returns a base64-encoded audio content that is decoded before returning:

```python
audio_content = response.json().get("audioContent")
return base64.b64decode(audio_content)
```

## Testing

Run the included test script to verify the API key implementation:

```
python test_google_wavenet.py
```

This will test three scenarios:
1. Short text (direct processing)
2. Medium text (still within limits)
3. Long text (requires chunking)
