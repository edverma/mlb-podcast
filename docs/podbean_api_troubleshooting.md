# Podbean API Troubleshooting

## Current Status

As of March 2025, we've encountered issues with the Podbean API file upload endpoint. The implementation has been modified to address these issues while maintaining functionality.

## Known Issues

1. **File Upload Endpoint Not Found (404)**: 
   - The upload API endpoints (`/files/uploadAuthorization` and alternatives) are returning 404 errors.
   - This suggests that either the endpoint has been changed or deprecated, or our credentials don't have permission to access it.

2. **Limited API Documentation**:
   - Podbean's public API documentation is limited, making it difficult to determine the correct endpoints and parameters.
   - The API may have changed since the documentation was last updated.

## Current Solution

To address these issues, we've implemented the following solutions:

### 1. Mock Mode

- The `PodbeanDistributor` class now includes a mock mode that simulates successful API responses.
- Mock mode is enabled by default and can be disabled for real API testing.
- This allows the rest of the application to function normally while the API issues are being resolved.

### 2. Multiple Endpoint Fallback

- The distributor attempts multiple possible endpoint URLs and request methods.
- It tries various combinations of:
  - Different URL paths (`/files/upload`, `/files/uploadAuthorization`, etc.)
  - Different HTTP methods (GET, POST, direct file upload)
  - Different request parameters

### 3. Robust Error Handling

- All API requests include comprehensive error handling and detailed logging.
- The system uses the `tenacity` library to retry failed requests with exponential backoff.
- Detailed error messages help diagnose API issues.

## Testing

We've created several test scripts to verify the functionality:

1. `test_podbean_auth.py`: Tests authentication with the Podbean API.
2. `test_podbean_api.py`: Tests individual API functions with detailed logging.
3. `test_podbean_e2e.py`: Tests the end-to-end workflow, from setup to distribution.

To run these tests:

```bash
# Test authentication
python tests/test_podbean_auth.py

# Test API with detailed logging
python tests/test_podbean_api.py

# Test end-to-end workflow
python tests/test_podbean_e2e.py

# Test with real API calls (not recommended until issues are fixed)
python tests/test_podbean_e2e.py --real
```

## Next Steps

1. **Contact Podbean Support**:
   - Reach out to Podbean developer support to clarify the correct API endpoints and requirements.
   - Ask for updated documentation or examples.

2. **Explore Alternatives**:
   - Check if Podbean offers any other upload methods or APIs.
   - Consider using their web interface or RSS feed import as a backup.

3. **Monitor API Changes**:
   - Regularly test the API for any changes or updates.
   - Update the code if Podbean modifies their API.

## Working Around the Issues

Until the API issues are resolved, you can:

1. Use the mock mode for development and testing.
2. Manually upload podcasts through the Podbean web interface.
3. Deploy the code with mock mode enabled, recognizing that actual distribution won't occur.
